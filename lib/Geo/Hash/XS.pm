=head1 NAME

Geo::Hash::XS - Geo::Hash in XS

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $gh = Geo::Hash::XS->new();
    my $hash = $gh->encode( $lat, $lon );  # default precision = 32
    my $hash = $gh->encode( $lat, $lon, $precision ); 
    my ($lat, $lon) = $gh->decode( $hash );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Geo::Hash::XS encodes and decodes geohash strings, fast. 

Currently this module is alpha quality (especially the C<adjacent()> and C<negihbors()> methods, which I just kind of copied the logic from elsewhere). Please submit tests and patches!

=head1 METHODS

=head2 $gh = Geo::Hash::XS->new()

=head2 $hash = $gh->encode($lat, $lon[, $precision])

Encodes the given C<$lat> and C<$lon> to a geohash. If C<$precision> is not
given, automatically adjusts the precision according the the given C<$lat>
and C<$lon> values.

If you do not want Geo::Hash::XS to spend time calculating this, explicitly
specify C<$precision>.

=head2 ($lat, $lon) = $gh->decode( $hash )

Decodes $hash to $lat and $lon

=head2 ($lat_range, $lon_range) = $gh->decode_to_interval( $hash )

Like C<decode()> but C<decode_to_interval()> decodes $hash to $lat_range and $lon_range. Each range is a reference to two element arrays which contains the upper and lower bounds.

=head2 $adjacent_hash = $gh->adjacent($hash, $where)

Returns the adjacent geohash. C<$where> denotes the direction, so if you
want the block to the right of C<$hash>, you say:

    use Geo::Hash::XS qw(ADJ_RIGHT);

    my $gh = Geo::Hash::XS->new();
    my $adjacent = $gh->adjacent( $hash, ADJ_RIGHT );

=head2 @list_of_geohashes = $gh->neighbors($hash, $around, $offset)

Returns the list of neighbors (the blocks surrounding $hash)

=head2 $precision = $gh->precision($lat, $lon)

Returns the apparent required precision to describe the given latitude and longitude.

=head1 CONSTANTS

=head2 ADJ_LEFT, ADJ_RIGHT, ADJ_TOP, ADJ_BOTTOM

Used to specify the direction in C<adjacent()>

    perl    3254/s     --  -100%
    xs   1257127/s 38532%     --

Obviously, the benefit of doing this calculation in XS becomes larger with
higher precision, but generaly you don't need precision > 10.
